# Vocab Builder Agent

This repository contains a **Vocab Builder Agent** developed using the OpenAI Agent SDK and the Gemini API. The agent is designed to assist users in enhancing their vocabulary by providing word suggestions, definitions, and contextual usage examples.

## Agent Overview

The **Vocab Builder Agent** is designed to provide vocabulary-building support. Upon receiving a prompt from the user, the agent responds with a word and its meaning, helping users learn new vocabulary. The agent is powered by the Gemini API and integrates with OpenAI's SDK to handle user interactions in a conversational format.

### Key Features:
- Provides word suggestions based on user input.
- Displays word definitions and usage examples.
- Helps users expand their vocabulary in various contexts.
- Records and stores its responses in a `output.md` file for future reference.

## How it Works

### 1. **Initializing the Agent**:
   The agent is initialized with a set of instructions:
   - **Instructions**: The agent is instructed to provide only a single word and its definition in response to each user prompt.
   - The agent is powered by the **Gemini API** for generating responses related to vocabulary.

### 2. **Processing User Input**:
   The agent listens for user input and processes it to generate a word and its associated details.

### 3. **Output to Markdown File**:
   The agent saves its responses in a markdown file (`output.md`). This file contains a log of the word, its definition, and any other relevant information provided by the agent.

### 4. **Example Interaction**:
   - **User Input**: "Give me a word."
   - **Agent Response**: "Eloquent - Expressing oneself clearly and effectively."
   - This response is saved to the `output.md` file.

## How to Run the Agent

1. **Set up your environment**:
   - Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Set your **Gemini API key** as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```

2. **Run the agent**:
   - Use the following command to start the agent and process user input:
     ```bash
     uv run run-agent
     ```

3. **Check the output**:
   - After running the agent, check the `output.md` file for the word and its definition generated by the agent.
